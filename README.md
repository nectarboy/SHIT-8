# SHIT-8
a horrible horrible CHIP-8 made in C with SDL<br>
(mainly a learning project for the willy wal :)

### wassup
it's still a WIP, and doesn't have sound, controls, etc<br>
and (so far) it only implements the original CHIP-8.

it passes the opcode test and the best coder test :3<br>
u can test it urself or look in the `pics` folder.

### u god games on ur fone
SHIT-8 has been made and tested for macOS, and idk if it'll compile for other systems !

if u wanna try it nonetheless, ull need makefile and SDL to compile !<br>
or u can download the binary file in the <kbd>releases</kbd> tab !

> there are some configuration options in `main.h`
> u can fiddle around if u want :3

### poop lol
building: `make` (builds the shit8 executable in the root !)<br>
running: `./shit8 folder/to/rom.file`
